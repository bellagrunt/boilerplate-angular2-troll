        <p>Everyday I will be updating this new post. I will add at least one
            or two different componends to the page as I go to mark my progress
            of the project. My goal is to build an angular2 app with fully integrated 
            automation to the page.

            Yesterday Feb 15th started to work on the contact page.
            Creating a "contact us" form.
            Today I figured out the login functionality in angular2.
            I created a new "login" page and then routed it in the navigation.
